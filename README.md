# Connect Right
by Team Avatar

## Inspiration
Connecting virtually during Quarantine does not retain the physical needs of human socializing. It is also difficult to find specific affinity groups in organizations. 
Solution: A more interactive virtual platform for socializing in organizations (workplaces, college campuses, etc). Users will have the opportunity to search for affinity groups to join.
